Furthermore numerical data comes in *serial* and *un-serial* formats, while categorical data comes in two types *Ordered* and *Unordered*. Ordered categorical data are where the responses are not numbers, but there is an order to them:  For example the quality of the roof on a house might be classified as:  Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Awful. While these responses will be strings or objects in Python and Pandas; there is an order to them. Unordered categorical data is where the responses to a question do not have a natural order. For example the color of a house would be an unordered categorical data.\n",

Well if more than 10% of the samples are above the actionable level, they are required by law to notify their customers that the city water may be contaminated with lead. At less than 10%of the samples being high, they did not need to notify anyone. \n",
