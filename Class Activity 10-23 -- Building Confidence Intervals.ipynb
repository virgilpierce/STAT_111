    "\n",
    "- 95% confidence is not really what we mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "The extent to which this means the median for all wine in this quality rating will be in this interval with a 95% chance depends on the extent to which our original sample was a truly random sample. It is as good an estimate as we can get with the data we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you can observe in this experiment:  In the quality ratings where we have more wines, we see much less variation in the median and thus a smaller region in which the populations value for this test statistic is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparing Populations: notes\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental problem with the hypothesis testing by resampling that we have done is that if the size of the subpopulations is very different, and in particular if one them is very small like in the wine database, that can lead to invalid conclusions if we try to resample the population. The labels will almost surely matter because the one population is so small.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases, the confidence interval approach is better as it instead tries to ask whether there is sufficient variablity within the label that the test statistics could overlap. Our goal in computing confidence intervals is not necessarily to accept or reject a hypothesis, but rather to understand where the true value of the test-statistic might lie. It penalizes populations that are small by giving wider intervals over which the true value might lie.\n",

    "## Next week:  Bayesian Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "Next week we will discuss how to use a formula called Bayes's Theorem to lift information from a population sample to update estimates on the probability of an event. This is a technique that also adapts to situations like this where the size of one of our categories in the sample is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will add that working with rare events is still very much an open problem that statisticians and data scientists are still developing techniques for. "
